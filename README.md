You know what rocks? Monads and Haskell and functional programming in general. You know what sucks? 
Someone dumping a few lines of type signatures on you and expecting you to immediately understand how that's in any way useful.


# 100 examples of monads by example - Functional Programming in Human Terms #
A lot of tutorials give you one or two examples and tell you to run with it from there. 
Not this one. We're in it for the long haul. If you don't get a specific example, hopefully the others should 
allow your brain to perform some pattern matching, and in a little time you should be able to see the Matrix.


It's nigh impossible to avoid discussing Haskell when discussing
functional programming, and for good reason. Haskell is beautiful in a mathematical sense, and 
many people can approach Haskell from this mathematical, definition-driven angle. However, if you're more
like me, I found this a substantial barrier to entry. While 
"Avoid success at at all costs" might be the playful unofficial Haskell slogan, I think a little bit of 
a heavier focus on learning by examples could do world of good. So I'll try to do that! 

I believe that if you learn by examples first, understanding can come naturally. And once you 'grok' the use, 
looking back at the definitions becomes much easier!


# Show, don't tell

* You **shouldn't** have to be a CompSci major to use functional programming
* You **shouldn't** need to know math to understand the implications of `flatMap`
* You **shouldn't** have to learn a fistfull of new weird operators such as `>>=`, `<$>` and `<*>` to make use of monads. (Although hopefully at the end you'll want to!)
* You **shouldn't** need to be told to learn to read Haskell type syntax just to undetstand what a Monad is.

This will hopefully be a collection of uses of Monads that will teach you through copious examples. 

# The goal is...
... to have at least 100 super-straight forward examples of Monads in action, each example hopefully rewritten in multiple 
forms and (if time and enthusiasm permits) multiple languages!


**IN PROGRESS:**
[Java Optional](JavaOptional.md) (80% done)
[Java Stream](JavaStream.md) (70% done)
